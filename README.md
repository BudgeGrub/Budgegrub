# Budgegrub

An app to help you budget as well as find restaurants suitable for your price range!
Simply enter your monthly net income and current location (or a location you may wish to move to).
You will be provided an expense form that will allow you to add an expense to a list that will be deducted from your budget.
At any time after you provide an income and location, you can request a list of a few restaurants near that location.
